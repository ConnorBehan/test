The film may contain adult themes or concepts that parents may wish to be aware of. If it has a romantic theme, it might have some sexual scenes or very brief nudity. It might also have some violence or mild bad language.\n*   **12A:** While the film is, in the opinion of the Censor, suitable only for people over 12 years of age, a person under that age may be admitted to see this film if he or she is accompanied by a parent or guardian.\n*   **15A: **While the film is, in the opinion of the Censor, suitable only for people over 15 years of age, a person under that age may be admitted to see this film if he or she is accompanied by a parent or guardian.\n*   **16: **Films classified in this category are considered to be suitable for persons of sixteen or over. Children under this age cannot be admitted to screenings. Violent content and depicition of violence may be stronger than in films designated 15A.\n*   **Over 18:** Only people over the age of 18 may attend a screening of this film. There will be adult themes and there may be explicit scenes of sex or violence. There may also be bad language, including strong sexual swear words.\n\nFor more detailed information on film classifications please visit the [IFCO Website](http://www.ifco.ie).",
